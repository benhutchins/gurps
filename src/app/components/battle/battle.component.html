            The Magic ST Bonus Level field is looking for the base bonus to ST that you have from all buff spells active,
            like the
            Gorilla Strength spell or the Mighty Roar
            spell. They provide a bonus of +1 OR +10% whichever is greater. This calculator knows that. If the total bonus
            you get
            from whatever combination of spells is
            +4 or +40% whichever is greater, you can just enter a value of "4" in the input box.

            Some of the buff spells that can provide ST give a flat bonus without offering a percentile possibility. And
            example is
            Shape Change which gives you temporary
            character points that can be spent to give yourself improved traits like Strength. It will always be in the form
            of +5
            or something like that. In that case you
            would just enter the value "5" in the input box.

          </td>
          <td class="help-text">
            The value for the Surge of Rage can be 1 to 6 currently, and it works like the normal buff spells such that each
            surge
            point gives you a +X or +Y%. Each surge point
            spent gives you +3 or +25% whichever is higher. All you need to enter in the input box is the number of surge
            points
            spent, and the calculator will do the rest.
            One important reminder is that the surge bonus is applied before any magic bonuses, so instead of adding
            percents like
            the normal buff spells do, they multiply.

            Skill Damage Bonus is about skill training allowing you to do more damage when you strike. At the time of
            creation of
            this calculator, the only two skills that
            grant a damage bonus are Brawling and Karate. If your Brawling skill is at least 2 levels higher than your
            Dexterity
            score, you get a +1 to damage unarmed. If
            your Karate skill is one level higher than your DX score, you get +1 damage... and if your Karate skill is at
            least 2
            levels higher than your DX score, you get
            +2 to unarmed damage. But if future changes are made to allow high skill with weapons to improve damage the
            calculator
            still works. Just enter the bonus to damage.

            on your level of the advantage. With the first level (costing 5 character points), you get +2 or +1/die. With

            Longsword is more likely to do higher damage than a Small Dagger. This field is where you'd enter the "2" or the
            "-1"
            (from the example). Whatever your weapon damage
            modifier is, is what goes in this input field.

            there are actually two input boxes next to "Weapon Flat or Per Die Mod". The left field takes the flat value,
            and the
            right field takes the per die value. When figuring
            out the final damage of your attack, the calculator will pick the one that results in a higher bonus.
